# Semester Project Submission Thinghy

Okay so essentially what this does is write and manage notes. There's a couple of functions, they handle note creation, listing, searching, reading, editing, & deleting. I decided I wanted to do this specifically because I use nvim w/ orgmode a lot to take my notes, and I thought it would be kind of cool to take a crack at it myself. I know this is kind of a simple explanation but most of my actual substantial stuff is in the code itself as commentary. It LOOKS like padding, I swear it isn't, I put a rough final count without comments at the end of yippee.cpp, if you must know it's some ~220 lines of functional code. It wasn't an exact science I just counted the lines and blanks and ignored my comments.

I don't plan to present this, I can take the grade hit. If the why *matters* then there's more info about it in the file itself. Thanks!
